 <chapter id="Intro">
  <title>libkcapi - Linux Kernel Crypto API User Space Interface Library</title>

  <para>This documentation applies to version @@LIBVERSION@@.</para>

  <para>
   The Linux kernel exports a network interface of type AF_ALG to allow user
   space to utilize the kernel crypto API.
  </para>

  <para>
   libkcapi uses this network interface and exports easy to use APIs so that
   a developer does not need to consider the low-level network interface
   handling.
  </para>

  <para>
   The library does not implement any cipher algorithms. All consumer requests
   are sent to the kernel for processing. Results from the kernel crypto API
   are returned to the consumer via the library API.
  </para>

  <para>
   The kernel interface and therefore this library can be used by unprivileged
   processes.
  </para>

  <sect1><title>Version Number Schema</title>
   <para>
    The version numbers for this library have the following schema:
    MAJOR.MINOR.PATCHLEVEL
   </para>

   <para>
    Changes in the major number implies API and ABI incompatible changes, or
    functional changes that require consumer to be updated (as long as this
    number is zero, the API is not considered stable and can change without a
    bump of the major version).
   </para>

   <para>
    Changes in the minor version are API compatible, but the ABI may change.
    Functional enhancements only are added. Thus, a consumer can be left
    unchanged if enhancements are not considered. The consumer only needs to
    be recompiled.
   </para>

   <para>
    Patchlevel changes are API / ABI compatible. No functional changes, no
    enhancements are made. This release is a bug fixe release only. The
    consumer can be left unchanged and does not need to be recompiled.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>Purpose Of AF_ALG</title>
   <para>
    With the presence of numerous user space cryptographic libraries,
    one may ask why is there a need for the kernel to expose its kernel
    crypto API to user space. As there are system calls and potentially
    memory copies needed before a cipher can be invoked, it should be
    typically slower than user space shared libraries.
   </para>

   <para>
    There are several reasons for AF_ALG:
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        The first and most important item is the access to hardware
        accelerators and hardware devices whose technical interface can
        only be accessed from the kernel mode / supervisor state of the
        processor. Such support cannot be used from user space except
        through AF_ALG.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        When using user space libraries, all key material and other
        cryptographic sensitive parameters remains in the calling
        application's memory even when the application supplied the
        information to the library. When using AF_ALG, the key material
        and other sensitive parameters are handed to the kernel. The
        calling application now can reliably erase that information
        from its memory and just use the cipher handle to perform
        the cryptographic operations. If the application is cracked
        an attacker cannot obtain the key material.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        On memory constrained systems like embedded systems, the additional
        memory footprint of a user space cryptographic library may
        be too much. As the kernel requires the kernel crypto API to be
        present, reusing existing code should reduce the memory footprint.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
   </para>

  </sect1>
 </chapter>

 <chapter id="Usage"><title>Programming Guidelines</title>
  <para>
   A consumer has to use the kcapi.h header file to link with libkcapi. The
   linking has to be performed using -lkcapi.
  </para>

  <para>
   In case a consumer does not want a shared library, the libkcapi C file and
   header file can also just copied to the consumer code and compiled along
   with it.
  </para>

  <para>
   A general requirement must be observed: setting of keys must be performed
   before any operation. Re-setting of keys is only permissible once
   all data in flight (sent to the kernel but the kernel's result is not yet
   obtained) is processed, i.e. no data is in flight any more.
  </para>

  <sect1><title>Symmetric Cipher API</title>
   <para>
    Symmetric ciphers can be used in the following different ways:
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        One-shot API: The one-shot API performs an encryption operation
        with one API call. With that API call, the caller provides the input
        data and immediately receives the output from the cipher operation.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Stream API: With the stream API, the caller can implement independent
        calls to send data to the kernel and receive data from the kernel.
        Multiple send calls can be inter-mixed with multiple receive calls.
        If the kernel buffer is full, the caller of a subsequent send call will
        be put to sleep. Conversely, if the buffer is empty, a caller trying
        to read data resulting from a cipher operation will be put to sleep.
        Sleeping callers will be woken up by the kernel once buffer space
        becomes available or data becomes available, respectively. The detached
        nature of the sending/receiving operation allows the implementation of
        multi-threaded applications where one or more threads send data and one
        or more threads receive data. The threads must operate on the same
        cipher handle. However, access to that cipher handle does not need to
        be serialized when the stream API calls are invoked as the API calls
        only read the cipher handle.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>AEAD Cipher API</title>
   <para>
    AEAD ciphers implement a very similar API approach as the symmetric ciphers:
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        One-shot API: The one-shot API performs an encryption operation
        with one API call. With that API call, the caller provides the input
        data and immediately receives the output from the cipher operation.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Stream API: With the stream API, the caller can implement independent
        calls to send data to the kernel and receive data from the kernel.
        However, unlike the symmetric cipher API, one AEAD cipher operation
        must be considered as one unit as the integrity value is calculated
        for one encryption or decryption operation. The caller can use multiple
        calls to provide the input data. The last chunk of data must be
        sent to the kernel with the API call marking the last submission.
        Then, the cipher operation can be triggered with the recvmsg invocation.
        It is possible to implement a multi-threaded application as the
        thread triggering the cipher operation is put to sleep until the last
        block is received. Once the last block is received, the caller waiting
        on the cipher operation is woken up to obtain the data.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
   </para>

   <sect2><title>AEAD Memory Structure</title>
    <para>
     When using the stream API for AEAD, the caller must observe a particular
     order of data components. It is permissible that for each of the following
     data components multiple send calls are used. But in total, all send calls
     must send the AEAD data in the following sequence:
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>Associated Authentication Data: The AAD must be provided as a first
      chunk.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>Plaintext / Ciphertext: Following the AAD, the entire plaintext
      or ciphertext is provided that shall be encrypted and integrity protected
      or decrypted and whose integrity shall be verified.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>(in case of decryption) Authentication Tag: If data is to be
      decrypted, the authentication tag must be supplied as the last data
      component.</para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>
     The caller must provide memory that is identical in size for the input and
     output data, even parts of the memory is unused. For example, forl
     encryption, the AEAD cipher operation only needs the AAD and the plaintext.
     Nonetheless, the interface requires that the memory is big enough to
     hold the tag as well. This requirement particularly aids the in-place
     cipher operation.
    </para>
    <para>
     If the caller chooses to not implement an in-place operation, the kernel
     will not copy the AAD data into the output buffer, but only the ciphertext
     or plaintext and the authentication tag (encryption only). Nonetheless,
     the kernel will place the plaintext / ciphertext and the authentication
     tag at the aforementioned locations, leaving room for the AAD. If a
     user requires the AAD to be present in the output buffer, the caller
     must memcpy it from the input buffer to the output buffer.
    </para>
   </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>Message Digest API</title>
   <para>
    Again, like for the symmetric ciphers, the message digest API implements
    the one-shot and the stream use cases.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>Asymmetric Cipher API</title>
   <para>
    The asymmetric cipher API provides access to the raw asymmetric operations
    (i.e. modular exponentiation).
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>Zero Copy</title>
   <para>
    When using the one-shot API for symmetric ciphers, AEAD ciphers,
    as well as message digests, the library uses the zero copy interface to
    provide the input data to the kernel. That means, the kernel operates on
    the user space pages.
   </para>

   <para>
    To ensure the efficiency of this zero copy approach, the caller should
    use a page-aligned data buffer for the input data. Non-aligned buffers
    would work also, but the kernel would need to perform more page
    accesses, lowering the throughput. Such an aligned buffer can be created,
    for example, using the following call - the value 4096 should be the size
    of one page on the system:
   </para>

   <programlisting>
    unsigned char buf[4096] __attribute__((__aligned__(4096)));
   </programlisting>
   
   <programlisting>
    unsigned char *buf;
    posix_memalign((void *)&amp;buf, PAGE_SIZE, buflen);
   </programlisting>
  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>Memory Allocation</title>
   <para>
    The library libkcapi uses the data structure struct kcapi_handle as the
    cipher handle that allows the consumer to operate with the various function
    calls of this library.
   </para>

   <para>
    Unlike other crypto libraries, libkcapi does not allocate any memory or
    performs operations that implies memory allocation. struct kcapi_handle only
    holds pointers to the consumer-provided buffers with sensitive data. That
    means that the buffers holding sensitive data like keys are under full
    control of the consumer. Therefore, this library does not offer any memory
    allocation or secure memory clearing functions.
   </para>

   <para>
    The consumer must ensure that the memory is appropriately sanitized. The
    caller does not need to sanitize struct kcapi_handle as it does not contain
    any sensitive data.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>Kernel Interfaces</title>
   <para>
    Depending on the version of your kernel, some of the kernel interfaces
    the library depends on are not available. When using the respective library
    API functions, an error is returned during initialization of the cipher
    handle. The following interfaces are available:
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>kcapi_md_* usable since kernel version 3.0</para></listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>kcapi_cipher_* usable since kernel version 3.0</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      kcapi_rng_* kernel interface integrated into kernel version 4.0
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      kcapi_aead_* kernel interface added to cryptodev-2.6 tree and should be
      usable with kernel version 4.2.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      kcapi_akcipher_* kernel interface is discussed for inclusion to the
      cryptodev-2.6 kernel tree.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

   <sect2><title>Kernel Configuration</title>
    <para>
     To use libkcapi, the following kernel options need to be enabled:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER enables the NETLINK_CRYPTO interface to allow
       obtaining information about the loaded ciphers. When compiled as module
       in older kernels (pre 3.18) the resulting crypto_user kernel module must
       be loaded manually.
      </para>
     </listitem>

       CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API enables the core functionality of the user space
       interface handler.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_RNG enables the "rng" interface to use the

     <listitem>
      <para>
       CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_AKCIPHER enables the "akcipher" interface to use
       the asymmetric ciphers. This support is currently discussed on LKML
